Now I have a running blog again there is also a central place to mention all the ideas and plans I have. Especially with regards to software development :). They can be divided into two parts (although both are about software development).

From the business side of things I am about to finalize my [business website](http://www.opilo.nl). If you go there now, you will find a static maintenance page. Until recently it was a Wordpress site, but these are more and more targets for hackers. And although I tried to keep it updated and added plugin-ins to disable a lot of stuff by default, it was still too much hassle. One of my reasons to move to a static site generator. But currently a new website is being created based on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website generator, just as this site is.

When that is done I intend to not only show my most current resume there, but also information on other services I provide. For now I am thinking at least at the following:

* Courses
  * Object oriented programming and design
  * Clean architecture
  * Unit and integration testing
* Services
  *
