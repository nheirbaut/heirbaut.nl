title: "Move to Hugo"

As stated in my [previous, and also first, post]({{< ref "/posts/first-post" >}}), I moved to a static website generator named [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). But after struggling on and to start fully working with it I decided to move away from it and move to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as my website generator. This was mainly because setting up the Jekyll environment within Ruby on Windows was not as straightforward as I wanted. To get started with Hugo, at least for installing it, using te excellent Windows package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), I just had to do:

```powershell
cinst hugo -y
```

And that was all. Even [adding and changing themes](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) is a breeze.

Now back to work for my business website. Any recommendations for a nice theme?
